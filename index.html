         </div>
        <p>I am a self-motivated individual who is always willing to learn and apply new skills while leveraging my broad experience.  I have performed various roles throughout my career as an engineer, programmer, project manager, naval architect, and data scientist.  My primary focus has recently been advancing the use of data analytics and visualizaiton to support data-driven decision making, and to create innovative automation tools to enhance efficiency.  In my current role, I have created tools using Python, JavaScript, Power BI, and internal artificial intelligence tools that automate historically manual tasks and save thousands of hours of manual labor on an annual basis.  I have led teams of up to 100 scientists, engineers, and technicians to solve complex promblems related to naval surface ships, undersea systems, and nuclear regulation.</p>
